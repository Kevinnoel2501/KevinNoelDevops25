# Azure DevOps CI/CD Setup (Short)

- Created a **common Azure Service Principal** to manage Azure resources.  
- Connected it to **Azure DevOps** via a service connection.  
- No free agents available, so used **personal laptop as self-hosted agent**.  
- Configured agent, linked to Azure DevOps, and ran pipelines through it.
