########### PIPELINE BUG ##############

Created a library group called dev-vars and defined a var 'print'

Tried printing this var in the pipeline.yml  without linking it even though the run passes the value is empty which will cause issues if its part of deployment

Fixed it by adding the variables section and defining this group. Which later prints the desired value.
